# learning-to-follow-instructions

This repository contains the implementation of my [master thesis](https://rezkaaufar.github.io/thesis.pdf) and the [fast-and-flexible](paper). This repository is not maintained anymore so if you want to find anything please browse through the source code.

The more recent and cleaner implementation is hosted [here](https://github.com/rezkaaufar/fast-and-flexible).
